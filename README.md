# 🛍️ Shopping Website Developed with ASP.NET 5
This is a shopping website developed using ASP.NET 5, which is well-suited for Persian websites. The website includes features such as user authentication and authorization, which were implemented using Identity 3.1 and the User Controller.
## 💻 Client-Side Development
For the client-side of the website, I used Razor Pages, a lightweight web framework that allows for rapid development of web applications. I also connected the Razor Pages to the application layer, which is responsible for handling business logic and data access.

## 🏛️ Clean Architecture Implementation
To ensure that the website is scalable and maintainable, I implemented the Clean Architecture pattern. This involved separating the different layers of the application - such as presentation, business logic, and data access - into distinct modules. By doing this, I was able to achieve a high degree of modularity, which makes it easier to maintain and extend the application over time.

## 🔌 Separation of Services and Database
Furthermore, I separated the services and database from the MVC framework, which helped to reduce coupling between different parts of the application. This made it easier to test and maintain the application, and also allowed for more flexibility in terms of adding or changing features in the future.

## 👍 Conclusion
Overall, this shopping website is a robust and scalable web application that is well-suited for Persian websites. It includes a range of features that are essential for an e-commerce website, such as user authentication and authorization, and has been developed using best practices and modern web development techniques.
